# Show the caret position of authors on your Etherpad um, Pad.

Important: A caret is not a cursor, a cursor is what your mouse uses.. A caret is the little stick used in a word processor.  The more you know....

Looking for the follow feature?  See ep_author_follow

## Features
* See where another authors caret is in really real time

## TODO

* Avoid race condition where the ACE object is sent and the cursor but the cursor arrives before the event

* Add a buffer

* Show the stick on the right when the righter px of the span is greater than the total width of outerdocbody IE the name doesnt fit on the screen

* Test Coverage
